show file systems

opaque: these are used for some internal functions. For example, if you use the show running-config command it internally links to the system:running-config file.
network: this is used to give the filesystem access to external systems like TFTP, FTP or HTTP servers. We can use this to copy files from these external sources to our filesystem.
disk: this is used for storage devices like our flash memory or USB sticks.
nvram: this is the internal NVRAM where the startup-config file is saved.

We can see the default folder that we are in with the pwd command:
copy flash:second-test-config.cfg flash:configs

mkdir flash:configs or just mkdir configs
cd configs
dir flash:configs
delete flash:configs/second-test-config.cfg
dir flash:configs
rmdir configs


mkdir backup
copy flash:first-test-config.cfg flash:backup
dir flash:backup
archive tar /create flash:backup-configs.tar flash:/backup
archive tar /table flash:backup-configs.tar <-- view the files in the tar file

mkdir new-configs
archive tar /xtract flash:backup-configs.tar flash:/new-configs
dir flash:new-configs

more flash:/first-test-config.cfg <-- view the config file in its txt form
