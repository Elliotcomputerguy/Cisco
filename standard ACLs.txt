access-list 1 deny <source> log
access-list 1 permit all

interface <num>
access-group 1 in 

show access-lists
show ip int <int>

for vty lines 
access-class 3 in

If you don’t like numbers you can also use named access-lists by choosing a name, this works for both standard and extended access-lists.

Before we continue let me give you some guidelines when setting up access-lists:

First we create an access-list globally and then we assign it to an interface.
You can only have a single ACL per direction, so it’s impossible to have 2 inbound access-lists.
Put the most specific statements at the top of your access-list because if a packet matches a statement the router doesn’t check if it matches any other statements.
Don’t forget the last statement is deny any. You don’t see it but it’s there

remove a single entry in your policy 
ip access-list extended 100
do show access-list 100
no 20

Extended ACLs should be located as close as possible to the source of the traffic to be filtered. 
This way, undesirable traffic is denied close to the source network, without crossing the network infrastructure. 
Standard ACLs should be located as close to the destination as possible
