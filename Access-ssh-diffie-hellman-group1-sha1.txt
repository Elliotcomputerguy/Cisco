The OpenSSH website has a page dedicated to legacy issues such as this one. It suggests the following approach, on the client:

ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 123.123.123.123
or more permanently, adding

Host 123.123.123.123
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
to ~/.ssh/config.
