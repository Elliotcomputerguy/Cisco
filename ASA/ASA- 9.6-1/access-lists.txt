access-lists outside_access_in extended permit tcp any host 172.16.0.2 eq http
access-lists outside_access_in extended permit tcp any host 172.16.0.2 eq https
access-lists outside_access_in extended permit deny ip any any

int <num>
access-group outside_access_in in interface outside

Traffic flow

               policy name    inbound       outisde interface 
                    |           |             |  
access-group outside_access_in in interface outside
                                     |
                                  what interface

So the above will permit traffic from internet inbound into the firewall and allow access to 172.16.0.2 eq http and https
