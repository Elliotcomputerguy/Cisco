asa access lists

The Cisco ASA firewall uses access-lists that are similar to the ones on IOS routers and switches.
Without any access-lists, the ASA will allow traffic from a higher security level to a lower security level.

Access-lists are created globally and then applied with the access-group command. They can be applied in or outbound.

When you create an ACL statement for outbound traffic (higher to lower security level) then the source IP address 
is the real address of the host or network (not the NAT translated one).

When you create an ACL statement for inbound traffic (lower to higher security level) then the destination IP address has to be:
The translated address for any ASA version before 8.3.
The real address for ASA 8.3 and newer.

The access-list is always checked before NAT translation.

To match IPv4 traffic then you should use “any4”. For IPv6 traffic, use “any6”. Any will catch both 4 and 6

                                              RULE 101
!!! when permittig or denying always put the interface that they are coming from in the access-group. !!!
    So if outside wants access to inside. Then it would be ' in interface outside' . Or from dmz then it 
    would be ' in interface dmz '. Denying access to outside from inside. 'out interface inside'

Access-list breakdown
access-list name extended <permit/deny> <protocol> [source] + [ source port] to [destination] + [destination port]
========================================================================================================================
Scenario [1]

lets deny traffic to destination 195.242.123.2 for tcp http for one source 192.168.0.2 and permit all other traffic.
========================================================================================================================
access-list inside_access_out extended deny tcp host 192.168.0.2 host 195.242.123.2 eq 80
access-list inside_access_out extended permit ip any any
access-group inside_access_out in interface inside
========================================================================================================================
Scenario [2]

lets permit icmp access from dmz source 172.16.0.1 to inside destination 192.168.0.2
========================================================================================================================
access-list dmz_access_in extended permit icmp host 172.16.0.1 host 192.168.0.2 echo
access-list dmz_access_in extended permit icmp host 172.16.0.1 host 192.168.0.2 echo-reply
access-group dmz_access_in in interface dmz
========================================================================================================================
Scenario [3]

permit telnet access to dmz host 172.17.0.2 from any outside address
========================================================================================================================
access-list outside_access_in_dmz extended permit tcp any host 172.16.0.2 eq 23
access-group outside_access_in_dmz in interface outside
========================================================================================================================
                                      RULE 102
          !!! You can only have one access-group per interface in either direction !!!
          check your acl does not conflict with another. Add to existing policies.
       Have a dmz_access_in and a dmz_access_out and outside_access_in etc and add to them
       Remember below each policy your create there is a deny any any so ensure you have added
       other ip addresses to be allowed or it will by default block. 

Example:
access-list dmz_access_in line 1 extended permit tcp host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.0.2 eq telnet
access-list dmz_access_in line 2 extended permit icmp host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.0.2 echo
access-list dmz_access_in line 3 extended permit tcp host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.0.2 echo-reply 
access-group dmz_access_in in interface dmz

access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 1 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.3 echo
access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 2 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.3 echo-reply
access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 3 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.2 echo
access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 4 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.2 echo-reply
access-group outside_access_dmz_in in interface outside

========================================================================================================================
object-groups
========================================================================================================================

An object-group lets you “group” objects, this could be a collection of IP addresses, networks, port numbers, etc. Instead 
of creating an access-list with many different statements we can refer to an object-group

========================================================================================================================
object-group options:

configure mode commands/options:
  icmp-type  Specifies a group of ICMP types, such as echo
  network    Specifies a group of host or subnet IP addresses
  protocol   Specifies a group of protocols, such as TCP, etc
  security   Specifies identity attributes such as security-group
  service    Specifies a group of TCP/UDP ports/services
  user       Specifies single user, local or import user group

icmp-type can be used to select all the different ICMP types, for example echo, echo-reply, traceroute, unreachable, etc.
network is used to select IP addresses and/or network addresses.
protocol lets you select an entire protocol. For example, TCP, UDP, GRE, ESP, AH, OSPF, EIGRP, and many others.
security is used for Cisco TrustSec.
service is used to select TCP and/or UDP port numbers.
user is to select local user groups for Identity Firewall.
