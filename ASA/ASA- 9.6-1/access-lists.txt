asa access lists

The Cisco ASA firewall uses access-lists that are similar to the ones on IOS routers and switches.
Without any access-lists, the ASA will allow traffic from a higher security level to a lower security level.

Access-lists are created globally and then applied with the access-group command. They can be applied in or outbound.

When you create an ACL statement for outbound traffic (higher to lower security level) then the source IP address 
is the real address of the host or network (not the NAT translated one).

When you create an ACL statement for inbound traffic (lower to higher security level) then the destination IP address has to be:
The translated address for any ASA version before 8.3.
The real address for ASA 8.3 and newer.

The access-list is always checked before NAT translation.

To match IPv4 traffic then you should use “any4”. For IPv6 traffic, use “any6”. Any will catch both 4 and 6

                                              RULE 101
!!! when permittig or denying always put the interface that they are coming from in the access-group. !!!
    So if outside wants access to inside. Then it would be ' in interface outside' . Or from dmz then it 
    would be ' in interface dmz '. Denying access to outside from inside. 'out interface inside'

Access-list breakdown
access-list name extended <permit/deny> <protocol> [source] + [ source port] to [destination] + [destination port]
========================================================================================================================
Scenario [1]

lets deny traffic to destination 195.242.123.2 for tcp http for one source 192.168.0.2 and permit all other traffic.
========================================================================================================================
access-list inside_access_out extended deny tcp host 192.168.0.2 host 195.242.123.2 eq 80
access-list inside_access_out extended permit ip any any
access-group inside_access_out out interface inside
========================================================================================================================
Scenario [2]

lets permit icmp access from dmz source 172.16.0.1 to inside destination 192.168.0.2
========================================================================================================================
access-list dmz_access_in extended permit icmp host 172.16.0.1 host 192.168.0.2 echo
access-list dmz_access_in extended permit icmp host 172.16.0.1 host 192.168.0.2 echo-reply
access-group dmz_access_in in interface dmz
========================================================================================================================
Scenario [3]

permit telnet access to dmz host 172.17.0.2 from any outside address
========================================================================================================================
access-list outside_access_in_dmz extended permit tcp any host 172.16.0.2 eq 23

                                      RULE 102
          !!! You can only have one access-group per interface in eithe rdirection !!!
          check you policy does not conflict with another and add to existing policies
       Have a dmz_access_in and a dmz_access_out and outside_access_in etc and add to them

Example:
access-list dmz_access_in line 1 extended permit tcp host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.0.2 eq telnet
access-list dmz_access_in line 2 extended permit icmp host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.0.2 echo
access-list dmz_access_in line 3 extended permit tcp host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.0.2 echo-reply
access-group dmz_access_in in interface dmz

access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 1 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.3 echo
access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 2 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.3 echo-reply
access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 3 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.2 echo
access-list outside_access_dmz_in line 4 extended permit icmp any host 192.168.1.2 echo-reply
access-group outside_access_dmz_in in interface outside
