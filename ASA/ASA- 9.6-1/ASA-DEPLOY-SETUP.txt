! inside and outside configuration

The lower security level the least it is trusted or the higher the security the zone the more it is trusted. 

lower security zones cannot access higher security zones. But higher security zones can access lower security zones.

DMZ cannot access Inside as DMZ is 50 and inside is 100 
Outside cannot access Inside as ouside is 0 and inside is 100
Inside can access both outside and DMZ as the inside security zone is higher than both dmz 50 and outside 0 

Inside is 100
Outside is 0
DMZ is 50
Management 99

so key point ... Highest zones are trusted. Lowest zones are least trusted.
