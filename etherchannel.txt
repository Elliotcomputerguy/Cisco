ensure you shut your interface before configuring or they will errdisable. 
ensure that the configuration on the interfaces are exactly the same !!! or it will errdisable
best to default interfaces. default int ra <>
put both interfaces into a channel-group and choose pagp or lagp and then add config on virtual interface 

8 links max in a bundled

if in errdisable ensure to shut the virtual interface and unshut.....
Once created. Any changes are required to be carried out on the virtual link. Not the physical interfaces or you will down the 
etherchannel.

channel-group 1 mode on = static (dont do it) unless layer 3 
channel-group 1 mode active = lacp
channel-group 1 mode passive = lacp if both side configued with passive. Etherchannel will not form. Active - active createa a little more chatter but reduces risk. Once formed no chatter.
channel-group 1 mode = auto pagp if both sides are auto etherchannel will not form. desirable and desirable will create more chatter. 
channel-group 1 mode = desirable pagp
