Protect: Ethernet frames from MAC addresses that are not allowed will be dropped but you wonâ€™t receive any logging information.
Restrict: Ethernet frames from MAC addresses that are not allowed will be dropped but you will see logging information and a SNMP trap is sent.
Shutdown: Ethernet frames from MAC addresses that are not allowed will cause the interface to go to err-disable state. You will see logging information and a SNMP trap is sent. For recovery you have two options:

errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation = global cmd to enable the recovery of security port shutdowns

errdisable recovery interval 'seconds' = global cmd to set time to wait before auto recovey of shutdown ports
