DHCP Snooping

DHCP snooping stops untrusted dhcp servers on your network. DHCP snooping is L2. 
DHCP snooping requires seceral configurations. You need to use global commands to enable snooping and another to list the vlans 
on which to use the DHCP snooping. Both must be included for for DHCP snooping to work.

You will often need to configure some ports as trusted ports as well. 
topology:

Trusted                      Untrusted
-----------------------------------------------
                    |
            G1/0/2  |  G1/0/3    
@------@-----------[=]-------[]client 1 - vlan 10
R1     R2           |_______________________[] clinet 2 - vlan 11
|                     G1/0/4

DHCP Server


The above topology has two vlans 10,11. In order to turn on dhcp snooping we need to enable it globally and 
specify what vlans we want it on for. We also need to add a trusted port on switch G1/0/2

global cmds:
ip dhcp Snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10,11
no ip dhcp snooping information option

int gi1/0/3
ip dhcp snooping trust

! confirm that it is enabled and on what vlans, dhcp snoop rate limiting
show ip dhcp snooping

Whats does this mean ?
no ip dhcp snooping information option

I rfc3046 DHCP relays add additional fileds to dhcp requests. Defined as option 82. DHCP snooping uses default settings
that work well if the switch is L3, meaning the switch should insert the option 82 into the field of a hdcp message. When the 
switch does not act as a dhcp relay agent, the default setting stops DHCP from working for end users. The switch
sets the field in DHCP messages as if it were a DHCP relay agent, but the changes to those messages cause most DHCP servers and most
dhcp relay agents to ignore recieved DHCP messgages. 

In order to make dhcp snooping work on a switch that is not also a dhcp relay agent, disable option 82 with the 
no ip dhcp snooping information option 



To stop attackers attacking dhcp snooping to limit the number of incoming dhcp messages. 

Global cmds: 
errdisable recovery cause dhcp-rate-limit = auto recover from dhcp errdiable events

errdisable reovery interval 30 = wait 30 seonds before auto recover the port
