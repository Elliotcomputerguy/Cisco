OSPF is a link state dynamic protocol 
OSPF PATH COST
OSPF uses path cost to determine what route to put in its route. It will only use the cost of the egress interfaces when 
calculating the path cost. 

OSPF uses a LSDB (link state databases) to keep all the lsa (link state advertisements)

OSPF router-id is 32 bits. they are used to identify the router
if a router-id is not configured it will use the highest loopback ip address
if the loopback address is not configured it will use the highest ip address

router-id <number>

show cmds
show ip router ospf 
show ip ospf int br
show ip ospf neighbor
clear ip ospf process to restart ospf algorithm 
show ip protocols
show ip ospf interface <>

OSPF DR (designated router) and BDR (backup designated router)
A DR is used to create adjacencies with all other routers on a broadcast network
reducing the requirement for every router to create adjancies with all other routers
A BDR is created in the event should the DR go offline.

DR and BDR are appointed based on the calcuation of the highest priority.
if all priority were the same the highest router id would be elected.

All other routers that are not a DR or a BDR are called DROTHERS

states:
init = start to see each other
2-way = they both see each other and are aware of each other
exstart/exchange = they both exchange lsa 
loading = they both load their lsdb lsa 
full adjacency = become neighbours

all ospf routers listen on multicast 224.0.0.5
only DR and BDR update on multicast 224.0.0.6

LSA types

1 = (router) individual router (advertises its connections,router id)
2 = (network) describes broadcast networks and other routers that are connected to the network DR will advertise the type 2
3 = (summary) networks not local to the area advertised by the ABR area border router

!Neighbor states:
FULL / - means a point to point link 
FULL/DR - local router has a neighbourship with DR 
FULL/BDR - local router has neighbourship with BDR
FULL/DROTHER - local router is ether a DR or BDR and the remote router is not a DR or BDR 
2WAY/DROTHER - local router is not DR or BDR and the reomte and local router do not form a neighbourship

!Passive interfaces:

Do not advertise OSPF advertisements on this interface. 

passive-interface <interface>

Globally enable passive-interface on every interface and enter the no passive-interface on the interface you wish to advertise ospf advertisements from.

passive-interface default 


!Default routers:

Advertise default routes via ospf

default-information originate

!OSPF costs:

interface 
ip ospf cost <number>

set bandwidth globally

auto-cost reference-bandwidth <speed>

Serial = 64 ospf cost
Ethernet = 10
Fast ethernet = 1
Gigabit = 1
10 gig = 1
100 gig = 1

!Router dr and bdr priority:

ospf elects a dr and bdr based on their router interface priority from 0 255 and then highest router id 

interface
ip ospf priority 99

point to point 
does not support broadcast as it is using ppp or hdlc and will not use a dr or a bdr. 

To configure you will need to issue 
int <num>
ip ospf network point-to-point

FULL / - means a point to point link 

!!! Important neighbor requirements !!!!
Hello and dead time intervals, MTU must match = show ip ospf interface
they must be in the same area = show ip ospf interface br
RIDS must be unique = show ip ospf
They must pass any neighbor authentication = show ip ospf interface
OSPF process must not be shutdown = show ip ospf, show ip ospf interface

!Configure ospf:

router ospf 1
router-id 1.1.1.1
network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 or on interface type ip ospf area 0 and will only advertise the /32 rather than the entire subnet.
passive-interface default 
interface <num>
no passive-interface

!shutdown ospf:
router ospf 1
shutdown
