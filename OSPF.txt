OSPF is a link state dynamic protocol 
OSPF PATH COST
OSPF uses path cost to determine what route to put in its route. It will only use the cost of the egress interfaces when 
calculating the path cost. 

OSPF uses a LSDB (link state databases) to keep all the lsa (link state advertisements)

OSPF router-id is 32 bits. they are used to identify the router
if a router-id is not configured it will use the highest loopback ip address
if the loopback address is not configured it will use the highest ip address

router-id <number>

show cmds
show ip router ospf 
show ip ospf int br
show ip ospf neighbor
clear ip ospf process to restart ospf algorithm 


OSPF DR (designated router) and BDR (backup designated router)
A DR is used to create adjacencies with all other routers on a broadcast network
reducing the requirement for every router to create adjancies with all other routers
A BDR is created in the event should the DR go offline.

DR and BDR are appointed based on the calcuation of the highest priority.
if all priority were the same the highest router id would be elected.

All other routers that are not a DR or a BDR are called DROTHERS

states:
init = start to see each other
2-way = they both see each other and are aware of each other
exstart/exchange = they both exchange lsa 
loading = they both load their lsdb lsa 
full adjacency = become neighbours

all ospf routers listen on multicast 224.0.0.5
only DR and BDR update on multicast 224.0.0.6

LSA types

1 = individual router (advertises its connections,router id)
2 = describes broadcast networks and other routers that are connected to the network DR will advertise the type 2

FULL / - means a point to point link
