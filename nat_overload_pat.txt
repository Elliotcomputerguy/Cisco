Quick concepts !

inside local = Private addresses, ports in LAN (i own it)                
inside global = it is the inside public interface (i borrow it) 
outside global = it is a public appliance or server you access that has a internet routable address assigned 
outside local =  it is a public appliance that has a private address that is being natted to allow it to be accessable on the internet


   inside local                             inside global           outside global
         |                                       |                        |
<private addresses>-----------<router>-----------------------<public server or appliance>
                                                                          | 
                                                                     outside local = private ip address of the public address     
nat overload/PAT configuration

! create a standard access list to allow only the defined source addresses to be natted

ip access-list standard access_list
    permit 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255
    permit 10.1.0.0 0.0.0.255

! identify the interface that the traffic will be egressing
int <num>
ip nat outside 

! add the inside to the the networks that will be natted
vlan 10
ip nat inside
vlan 20
ip nat inside 
etc

ip nat inside source list access_list interface <num> overload

show ip nat translations
clear ip nat translations *

! dynamic nat and pat 

ip access-list standard access_list
    permit 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255
    permit 10.1.0.0 0.0.0.255

ip nat pool pool_name 195.242.123.1 195.242.123.255 prefix-length /24
ip nat inside source list access_list pool pool_name overload
