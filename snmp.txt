An snmp manger is a network manager application running on a pc or server. The server is called a NMS (network management server)

The smtp agent is software running on a device with knowedge of all the variables on that device that describes the deviceconfiguration, status, counters etc .

Ther SNMP manager uses SNMP protocols to communicate with each SNP agent. 

Each agent keeps a db of variables that make up the parameters, status and counters for operations of the device. 
Management information base (MIB) are variables that can be pulled from a device. They reflect some feature or functino setting
on a device. The MIB is pulled or sent to the NMS by the snmp agent on that device. 
The MIB defines each device variable as a Object ID (OID) and organises into a heirarchy.   

snmp uses get request and get response

snmp agents send a trap or inform snmp message to the NMS to list teh state of a certain MIB variable when it reaches a certain state

If a interface went down on a router and a trap is set, the trap would inform the snmp NMS.

inform messages hae the exact same purpose as trap but differ in protocol mechanisms. Inform are like trap messages but with 
reliability added in snmp v2. 

all snmp is clear text apart from v3 v3 has message integrity, checks for message replay, authentication and encryption.
