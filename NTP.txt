To configure NTP you need to set the clock timezone and set the date and time before you synch with an external or ntp server.

Basic NTP configuration:

ntp master {stratum level}: NTP server mode - the device acts only as a NTP server and not a client. 

ntp server {address | fqdn}: NTP client/server mode. the device acts as both client and server, first it is a client to synchronize,
                             once synchronized it will become a server and supply to other clients.


Example: 

            R1       172.16.2.2  R2         172.16.3.3  R3
    -------{@@}-----------------{@@}-------------------{@@}
cmd:     ntp server          ntp server             ntp master 
         172.16.2.2          172.16.3.3

         Stratum 4            Stratum 3             Stratum 2 

R3 acts as a NTP server only 
R2 & R1 acts as a client/server

ntp master uses its own internal device hardware to determine the time. The lower the stratum the more it is trusted. NTP client adds 1 to the 
stratum level it learns from its ntp server. So that the stratum level increases the more hops away from the original clock source. 

Routers and switches use a default stratum level of 8 as their internal reference hardware. NTP considered 15 to be te highest useful
stratum level. Anything past 15 is considered unusable. 

Redundant NTP configuration:

1: establish an association with a internet time source with the ntp server cmd
2: establish an internal clock using the ntp master {stratum} command
3: set the stratum level of the internal clock to a higher stratum level than the internet based ntp servers
4: synch with the best (lowest) known time source. being the internet based ntp server

The ntp server has a stratum level of 1, the internal device clock has a stratum of 7 so all clients will use the ntp server.

ntp master 7


Configure a loopback address on your master NTP incase any interfaces go down.
